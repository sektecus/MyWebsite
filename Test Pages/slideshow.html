                                    <p>As this is my first posting, I want to preface the following rant by
                                    pointing out that this page is not meant to serve as a fitness blog or food
                                    blog or otherwise. For that matter, I never wanted to have a blog. That
                                    said, for professional reasons, I needed to make a website, so despite the
                                    fact that most people create a website so they can have a blog, I'm creating
                                    a blog so that I can have a website. The topics of this blog, of sorts, will
                                    vary, and it just so happens the first one is about food, fitness, and
                                    health. With that out of the way, here we go.<span data-toggle-target=".full-text" 
                                    class="toggle-btn read-more" data-toggle-text="Hide full text...">Read more...</span></p>
                                </div>    
                                <div class="full-text">    
                                    <p>Have you heard of that new diet? The one that's supposed to be super easy
                                    to follow? The one that works like magic? Right, I'm sure you have - and I'm
                                    sure, depending on who you ask, the diet in questions is always different.
                                    It would seem, given our lack of food insecurity in this country, the masses
                                    are always looking for new ways to trick themselves into eating better,
                                    being healthier, getting in better shape, etc. Well, you can probably tell
                                    from the tone of this paragraph, to this point, that I've taken exception to
                                    some or all of this. Well, that is partially correct, so points to you for
                                    being perceptive. It's not that simple though. No, scratch that - I should
                                    say, it's much simpler and much more difficult than you think. I'm not
                                    trying to suggest that there's anything wrong with wanting to be healthier -
                                    quite the opposite, in fact. I'm 33 years old and, up to this point, have
                                    spent more than half of my life in various states of poor health. From
                                    smoking to obesity to low carb (yes, you read that right), I've been around
                                    the block a few times. Despite all of that, I believe I have finally found
                                    myself in a state of relatively good health and, although future-me may look
                                    back and point out how wrong I am (as I am doing here with past-me), I
                                    believe I've got it all figured out this time. So let's take a journey,
                                    first to my past failures and then to me recent successes. At the end of
                                    this journey, you may come to the same conclusions that I have about weight,
                                    health, and the latest fad diet - that conclusion, of course, no matter how
                                    you achieve weight loss, it all breaks down to simple arithmetic and
                                    revolves around consuming fewer calories than you use.</p>
